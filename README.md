# coinbaseApiMonitoring

This project is to start learning how to monitor with an api, load data into tableau and help use time series analysis to make decisions with APIs.

You will require a python Integrated Development Environment(IDE). 

Packages Requires -   cbpro   pandas

Install packages by using pip install pandas / pip install cbpro

Issues may asrise with installing packages, my recommendation is to practice using stakeoverflow which is an extremely useful skill and emailing me. Feel free to create an issue on the git.

The next step is going to be setting up a file location for the code to run.

fileLoc = r"C:\Users\mryagerr\Desktop\Project Trader\jsons\\"

This is an example of where I am having the data deploy. 

This should be enough to get the script to start.
